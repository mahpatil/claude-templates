# Technology Decision Framework

Use this framework when making significant technical decisions.

## Decision Steps

| Step | Considerations |
|------|---|
| **1. What Problem Are We Solving?** | • Business context<br>• Technical constraints<br>• Success criteria |
| **2. What Are the Options?** | • Option A: [Description]<br>• Option B: [Description]<br>• Option C: [Description] |
| **3. Evaluation Criteria** | • Performance<br>• Cost<br>• Complexity<br>• Time to market<br>• Operational burden |
| **4. Decision & Rationale** | • Chosen: Option X<br>• Why: [Specific reasons]<br>• Trade-offs accepted: [What we gave up] |
| **5. Validation Criteria** | • How will we know this was right?<br>• What metrics will we track?<br>• When will we revisit this? |

## Key Principles

- **Document the Why**: Always record the reasoning behind decisions, not just the decision itself
- **Data-Driven**: Use objective criteria and measurements
- **Reversibility**: Prefer decisions that can be easily reversed
- **Team Alignment**: Ensure stakeholders understand and agree with the decision
- **Continuous Validation**: Regularly measure against success criteria and adjust as needed
