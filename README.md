## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains battle-tested technical standards and practices developed over 20 years of building production systems at scale (American Express, Apple, and Fortune 500 enterprises). Each standard includes:

- **Architecture Blueprints**: Visual diagrams and system designs
- **Implementation Code**: Production-ready code samples
- **Non-Technical Guides**: Business-friendly explanations
- **Multi-Cloud Examples**: AWS, Azure, and GCP implementations

## 👨‍💻 For Technical Teams

### Engineers

Each standard includes production-ready code samples:
```python
# Example: Event-driven architecture
from events.producer import EventProducer

producer = EventProducer()
producer.publish_event(
    topic='orders',
    event_type='com.example.orders.created',
    data={'order_id': '12345', 'amount': 99.99}
)
```

### DevOps/SRE

Terraform modules, Kubernetes manifests, and CI/CD pipelines:
```terraform
# Example: Multi-AZ high availability setup
module "ha_infrastructure" {
  source = "./standards/high-availability/terraform/aws"
  
  region_primary   = "us-east-1"
  region_secondary = "us-west-2"
  rto_minutes      = 60
  rpo_seconds      = 5
}
```

### Architects

Architecture decision records (ADRs) and design patterns:

- When to use Event-Driven Architecture (coming soon)
- Multi-Cloud Strategy (coming soon)

## 💼 For Non-Technical Stakeholders

Each technical standard includes a **business-friendly explanation**:

- **What it is**: Plain English explanation
- **Why it matters**: Business impact (revenue, customer satisfaction, compliance)
- **Cost & ROI**: Investment requirements and returns
- **Risks**: What happens if we don't do this
- **Metrics**: How we measure success

Example: High Availability for Executives (coming soon)
